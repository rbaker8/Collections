### Collections library

The Collections Library contains my multiple Java implementations of many of the classic data structures such as lists, deques, queues, stacks, maps, sets and trees.  Currently, the HashMap implementation is a copy of the java.lang.HashMap implementation.  Unit tests exist for each implementation of a collection interface.

### Implementation
#### RichList

The Richlist interface has implementations using an array and a linked list

#### RichDeque

The Richdeque interface has implementations using arrays and linked lists.  It is used to implement RichQueue and RichStack

#### RichQueue

The RichQueue interface has implementations using a circular buffer array to provide O(1) insertions and deletions.  Other implementations extend a RichDeque implemented either as an array or linked list.

#### RichStack

The RichStack interface has implementations using a linked list RichDeque

#### RichMap

The RichMap interface has implementations using hash tables with bins that are either linked lists or binary trees.  This is currently the stock Java implementation

#### RichSet

The RichSet interface extends the RichCollection interface and has a linked list hash table map implementation

#### RichTree
